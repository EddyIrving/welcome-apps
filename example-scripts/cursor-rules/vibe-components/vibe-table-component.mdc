## Building tables correctly
- The monday `Table` component must have the following props: `columns`, `emptyState` and `errorState`. 
- The children of the `Table` component must be `TableHeader` and `TableBody`.
- The children of `TableBody` are a list of `TableRow` components as children. 
- The children of `TableRow` are a list of `TableCell` components as children. 
- The children of `TableHeader` should be `TableHeaderCell` components with a `title` prop.
