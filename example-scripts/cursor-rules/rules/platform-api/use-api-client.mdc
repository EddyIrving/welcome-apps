## Using monday client libraries to make GraphQL API calls

- Use the `@mondaydotcomorg/api` package to call the monday API
- Read the client documentation at @https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mondaydotcomorg/api
- Prefer the `@mondaydotcomorg/api` package over the "monday-sdk-js" package for making API calls

### Installing the API client
- If `@mondaydotcomorg/api` is not in the project dependencies, install it:
```bash
npm install @mondaydotcomorg/api
```

### Using the API client
- Use the `ApiClient` class to make API calls from the server-side, such as Node.js environments. 
- Use the `SeamlessApiClient` class to make API calls from the client-side, such as in React environments.
